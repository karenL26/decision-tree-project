The goal of this project is to classify patients having diabetes or no, based on their diagnostics.

In this project you can find some basic exploratory analysis and the data preparation for modeling [here](src/explore-dt.ipynb).

The model construction use decision trees and it was applied to it hypertune. 

The pipeline construction is [here](src/app.py).
